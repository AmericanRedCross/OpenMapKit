# OpenMapKit

OpenMapKit is a project started by the American Red Cross that builds on top of OpenDataKit. OMK has a few components:

[OpenMapKitAndroid](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/OpenMapKitAndroid) is the android client.

Install and workflow information is available on [openmapkit.org](https://openmapkit.org).

[OpenMapKitWebsite](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/OpenMapKitWebsite) is the website for the project. We are moving all training materials within the wiki to the website.

[OpenMapKitServer](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/OpenMapKitServer) is the server side piece similar to ODK Aggregate.

OpenMapKit and OpenMapKitServer are key components of [POSM](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm), a project to integrate best-of-breed tools from a variety of sources and developers on a single device that can be deployed to the field alongside Red Cross staff and volunteers and facilitate mapping efforts, particularly when internet access is absent.
